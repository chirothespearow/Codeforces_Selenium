# Codeforces_Selenium
How the script works:

1)The script imports all required modules/functions required to run the program (Webdriver, keys from Selenium)

2)The script takes the inputs for required fields like username, email-id, password.

3)Chromedriver is opened and the codeforces website is opened in a new chrome window.

4)All the required fields are populated with the user defined variables.

5)'Register' button is clicked by the script.
